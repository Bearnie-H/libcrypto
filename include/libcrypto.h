    Libcrypto

    This is an academic implementation of a selectable block or stream cipher,
    based on either AES (Rijndael), or the ChaCha encryption algorithms.

    This library provides a correct implementation of these ciphers,
    but this is not suitable for production systems, as only minimal
    effort has been put towards addressing side-channel or timing
    attacks. This library only guarantees algorithmic correctness.

    Cipher_Prepare

    This function will prepare a new Cipher_t object for use. It will use the specified
    encryption algorithm, in the specified mode, using the given Key. The value pointed
    to by "Key" will have a number of bytes read depending on the key length specified
    by the selected Algorithm.

    The value chosen for the IV is interpreted differently based on the specific
    Algorithm and Mode selected. See the descriptions of the options for
    Cipher_Algorithm_t and Cipher_Mode_t for a description of how the IV
    will be interpreted.

    Inputs:
    Algorithm   -   The specific encryption algorithm to use in the Cipher.
    Mode        -   The mode of operation to use for multi-block encryption.
    Key         -   The raw key bytes to use in the cipher.
    IV          -   The raw bytes to use as the IV. (Mode specific)

    Outputs:
    Cipher_t*   -   NULL on error, otherwise a fully prepared and ready-to-use
                    Cipher_t object to be used with the Cipher_Encrypt() or

    This function allows updating of the Initialization Vector (IV) to be used
    by the Cipher. How this vector is interpreted differs based on both the mode
    of operation, and the specific algorithm used. See the descriptions provided
    on the options for the Cipher_Algo_t and Cipher_Mode_t types for more information.

    Inputs:
    Cipher  -   Pointer to the (at least partially) initialized Cipher object to update IVs for.
    IV      -   Pointer to the raw bytes to use as the new IV. This will overwrite any existing
                    value in the Cipher.

    Cipher_Encrypt

    This function will use the Cipher_t to encrypt the given Plaintext, which is 'Length' bytes

    specified when the Cipher_t was prepared, as well as using the specified Mode.

    Inputs:
    Cipher      -   Pointer to a previously prepared Cipher_t object.
    Plaintext   -   Pointer to the raw plaintext to encrypt.
    Length      -   The length of the Plaintext, measured in 8-bit bytes.
    Ciphertext  -   Pointer to a location to write the encrypted ciphertext to.
                        The memory must be owned by the caller, and it must
                        be large enough to accept the fully encrypted output.

    Cipher_Encrypt_Stream

    This fucnction will use the Cipher_t to Encrypt the given stream,

    capable of being operated on by the standard read() and write() calls.
    These file descriptors are not owned by this function, and must be
    opened and closed by the caller.

    This function will safely align blocks, such that intermediate reads will
    wait until one full block of data is ready, rather than padding partial
    blocks. Only the final block, if it does not evenly divide the block size,
    and the underlying cipher mode and algorithm imply block-operation, will be
    padded to fit.

    Inputs:
    Cipher  -   Pointer to the Cipher object to use.
    fd_In   -   File descriptor to read raw data from, using read().
    fd_Out  -   File descriptor to write resultant data to, using write().

    This function will use the Cipher_t to decrypt the given Ciphertext, which is 'Length' bytes
